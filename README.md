### Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

#### Abstract
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), introduced by Teuvo Kohonen, are a type of unsupervised neural network used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. SOMs project high-dimensional input data onto a typically two-dimensional grid of neurons while preserving the topological relationships in the data. During training, neurons compete to become the Best Matching Unit (BMU), and nearby neurons are adjusted to resemble the input, promoting smooth transitions across the map. This process allows SOMs to cluster similar inputs and reveal inherent structures within complex datasets. Due to their interpretability and efficiency, SOMs are widely used in fields such as pattern recognition, image analysis, and exploratory data mining.

#### Dataset
